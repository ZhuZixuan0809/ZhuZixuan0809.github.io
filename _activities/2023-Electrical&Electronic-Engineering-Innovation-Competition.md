Our "GaN-based Small-scale High-efficiency Inverter for Optical Storage" won The First Prize in East China Region. [Here is the Certification](https://zhuzixuan0809.github.io/files/Activities/浙江大学-2023电气电子工程创新大赛华东一等奖.pdf)

We independently designed and successfully manufacture a sample of our Inverter.

In our team, **Market Investigation**, **Documentation** and **Component Selection** are my main jobs.
