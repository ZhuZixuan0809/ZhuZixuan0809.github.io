The research project was the subproject of a research on energy storage demand and operation mechanism conducted by [CSG](https://www.csg.cn/), which was **conducted independently by me and another student**.

Based on the theory of full life cycle, The project aims to build the cost measurement model and comprehensive evaluation system of new energy storage. Also, the project would offer some ideas about the tariff mechanisms when new energy storage is marketed on the generation side and demand side.

The final output of the project includes two Conference Articles and a patent.
