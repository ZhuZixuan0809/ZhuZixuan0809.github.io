Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Zhu Zixuan, a third-year undergraduate student from [College of Electrical Engineering](http://ee.zju.edu.cn/) of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

I am very fortunate to be instructed by [Prof.Shi Tingna](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0018202). 

Here you may find many courses of EE, and my recent research and posts of my life.

Be like: わたしの彼女はDu Junanです. We will go to Hainan for our anniversary. 

Please feel free to take my work as reference to your academic life.
